        Throughout my time in this world I have always wanted to be a creator, yet I never saw myself as such. I strived to become something 
        along the lines of an artist, a designer, a [creative], but never had any drive. My vision was blurred. It very well may still be. What's changed, is that I don't care
        anymore. I have no set path. I'm destined to become what I am, and what I was, and what I will be. From the start of the cosmos every destination was set, every 
        atom was aware, everything was in it's proper place. There is no randomness, only our impending outcomes. I am meant to be here. I am a creator.
